âœ¨ Hi! I'm Marcy, a Lead Software Engineer on the DevRel/Community team at [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com), a website startup, where I champion accessibility and developer experience. I've also worked on accessibility testing tools and love building inclusive user interfaces. My repos contain a mix of all of those things! Where my contribution graph is blank, it's probably because I was out riding a bicycle, hiking with my dog, or snowboarding.
