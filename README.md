âœ¨ Hi! I'm [Marcy Sutton](https://marcysutton.com), a Lead Software Engineer on the DevRel/Community team at [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com), where I champion accessibility and developer experience with regular [livestreams](https://twitch.tv/gatsbyjs) and community initiatives. I've also worked on the [axe](https://deque.com/axe) accessibility testing library and love building inclusive user interfaces. My repos contain a mix of all of those things. ðŸŒˆ

Where my contribution graph is blank, it's probably because I was out riding a bicycle, hiking with my dog, or snowboarding. Life is short!
